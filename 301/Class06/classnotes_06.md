**Who is Roy Fielding?**

- Roy Fielding is an engineer who started building the web so we'd be able to talk to any machines anywhere in the world and we use them today to have computers talk to each other. 

---

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

- That's because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding started building the web, the goal was to be able to talk to any machine in the world. Most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those same requirements as past machines. 

---

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

- HTTP is like applying verbs to nouns. When you get to a web page the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and comes back a web page. 

- The web page species the URLs to the image and browser goes and does mroe GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. 

**What does a GET do?**

- Get is a universal command that's used in coding to get requested data. 

---

**What does a POST do?**

- Post adds something from one system to another system.

---

**What does PUT do?**

- Put replaces something in one system from another system.

---

**What does PATCH do?**
