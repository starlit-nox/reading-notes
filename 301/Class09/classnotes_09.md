### **Functional Programming Concepts**

<https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa>

**What is functional programming?**

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

---

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function**

- A pure function is the first fundamental concept that is leanred when we want to understand functional programming. 

---

**What are the benefits of a pure function?**

- given the same input, will always return the same output
- produces no side effects

---

**What is immutability?**

- immutability is when a data's state can't be changed after it's created

- if an object has immutability, you have to create a new object with a new value to change it

---

**What is Referential transparency?**

- if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent

### **Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()**

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k>

**What is a module?**

- its essentially another javascript file (from the video)

- a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application (from google)

---

**What does the word ‘require’ do?**

- require passes thru a string which we require from a file (from the video)

- In NodeJS, require() is a built-in function to include external modules that exist in separate files. require() statement basically reads a JavaScript file, executes it, and then proceeds to return the export object. (from google)

---

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

- we need to import the module by using the require keyword at the top of the file so the result of require is stored in a variable which is used to ivoke the functions using the dot notation 

---

**What do we have to do to make a module available?**

- we do module.exports and set it equal to whatever we want to be maded avaliable outside the module (from the video)
