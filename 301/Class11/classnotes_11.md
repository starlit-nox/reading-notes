## Why It's Important

This information is important because it shows us the difference between the SQL and NoSQL databases. It prepares us for our projects and future applications to decide which database will be right for us in our careers. Each database has its goods and bads, so you have to determine which one you need for certain applications and projects.

SQL

1. Databases are primarily called Relational DataBases
2. Table based
3. Predefined schema
4. Vertically scalable which increases horse-power of hardware
5. SQL use SQL for defining and manipulating data which is very powerful

NoSQL

1. NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed database
2. Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-columns stores
3. Dynamic schema for unstructured data
4. Horizontally scalable which increases database serves in the pool of resources to reduce overload
5. NoSQL queries focus on collections of documents (UnQL). Syntax varies from database to database

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

- It's good for complex query intensive environments.

---

**Give a real world example.**

- There's a store and the owner wants to keep track of their stock in a database. They can create a SQL database to store all the information about their products (name, brand, quantity, etc.) They'd just use SQL to create a table called "Products'' with columns for each category of information. 

---

**What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?**

- Hierarchical data storage as follows the key-value pair similar to JSON data.

---

**Give a real world example.**

- A store wants to keep tabs on their data about customer interactions for a survey. They have the ratings, the comments, and the dates which they shop. They'd want to be able to retrieve this data in order to display it during meetings. NoSQL databases can pull this information by the dates which they shop to view the surveys.

---

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

- NoSQL

---

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

- SQL since you can update the CPU, RAM, or SSD on a single server to keep it scaling  while NoSQL you have to add more servers.

### **sql vs nosql (video)**

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_kXvOeQ5Y>

**What does SQL stand for?**

- Structured Query Language

---

**What is a relational database?**

- we have a database which works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it support the sq language

---

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

- it works with tables

---

**What is a ‘schema’?**

- is structure for the data fields in the table

---

**What is a NoSQL database?**

- its a database that stores lots and lots of data in a very efficient way something that SQl struggles with

---

**How does it work?**

- it has collections instead of tables with documents in each section (they work like rows and look like json)

they don't have to use the shame schema

---

**What is inside of a MongoDB database?**

- collections, tables, documents

---

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

- MongoDB is more flexible because it doesn't have a schema or structure so you can manipulate it more freely.

---

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

- You have duplicated data
- If something changes you have to update it in all collections
