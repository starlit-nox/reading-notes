### **Status Codes Based On REST Methods**

<https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/Which-HTTP-Status-Code-To-Use-For-Every-CRUD-App/>

**In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:**

**100’s** = there is an issue with the header part of the request

**200’s** = these are sucess codes, it lets the request show that its been accepted (when its a 202 request it means it isn't sucessfuly processed when its asynchronous)

**300’s** = these are redirection codes and it tells the client what they're requesting isn't available at the expected page anymore 

**400’s** = these are client error codes, it tells the user that the requests are invalid (timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication, etc.)

**500’s** = these are server error codes. these are problems with overwhelmed or unreachable servers behind proxies
