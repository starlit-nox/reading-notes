# Introduction to React and Components

## Why It's Important

Its important to know this because the acroynom is the common logic that coding uses. Its also good to be able to think ahead on what HTTP Method different applications will need for their api. 

## More CRUD

**What is CRUD?**

**Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?**

- Rest is an architectural style of building 

- Crud is a set of common operations used for data management

Rest uses HTTP methods to map the crud operations to provide uniform interfaces to acess and manipulate reosurces over the web. Overall, together they promote scalability, reliability, and security.

**If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**

1. Think of what you want to create and how you want to organize these ideas.

2. Once you have your idea then make a plan or blueprint on how you want it to work and how the features will function.

3. Put your plan into action. Begin building the code for it and testing it.

4. Test your creation and debug it. You need to make sure it works before you release it to the public.

5. Share what you just created.
