# Introduction to React and Components

## Why It's Important

This topic is important because it teaches React JS. The main use of it for coders is how it allows a lot more reusability for code, which will save time.

## Component-Based Architecture

## Reading Q&A

### **Component-Based Architecture**

<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm>

**What is a "component"?**

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functional code that captures its implementations and exports it as a higher level interface for users. 

It also is a software object that is used to interact with other components.

---

**What are the characters of a component?**

- **Reusability:** Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task

- **Replaceable:**  Components may be freely substituted with other similar components

- **Not Context Specific:** Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts

- **Extensible:** Component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior

- **Encapsulated:** Components depict the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- **Independent:** Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components

---

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

- **Ease of Deployment:**  As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- **Reduced Cost:** The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- **Ease of Development:** Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- **Reusable:** The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- **Modification of Technical Complexity:** A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- **Reliability:** The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- **System Maintenance and Evolution:** Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- **Independent:** Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

### **What is Props and How to Use it in React**

<https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProps%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20special%20keyword,way%20from%20parent%20to%20child>

**What is "props" short for?**

Props is a special keyword in React. It stands for properties. 


---

**How are props used in React?**

They are used for passing data from one component to another. 

---

**What is the flow of props?**

Its uni-directional, which means the data coming from the parent **should not** be changed by child components
