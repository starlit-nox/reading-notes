---

**In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**

- The V8 JavaScript Engine is an open source JS that Chrome based browsers and applications use. It’s very responsive and some applications, like Node, is built on it. The V8 is responsible for compiling and executing all the code in your web browser too so you can load pages. 


---

**What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

- It means we can use Nods.JS to execute JavaScript applications. 

“However, when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.” - The Reading

### **6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

<https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/>

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

---

**In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

- The reason I found most beneficial is learning from fellow students. My peers explain the code in a layman-like term for me to be able to understand a bit easier than the instructors some of the time which aids me in my learning.

---

**How does pair programming work?**

- Pair programming works by adding two individuals together to practice their work. Two developers share a single workstation to interactively tackle coding tasks together. It's a way to foster a collaborative environment.
