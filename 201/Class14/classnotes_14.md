2. clear goals
3. culture of dependability

**Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**

in a professional setting, i had a somewhat healthy amount of psychology safety in the work place. the the work team was confident in their work and if they weren't and mistakes happened they would not shame, reject, or punish for mistakes, accidents, and misunderstandings. the goals of the day were clear and if they weren't, the team leaders were willing to clarify or re-iterate throughout the day. as for dependability, that's another story. the team leaders are dependable but the co-workers i had were not. 

**What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**

teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety in their company/team tend to have a positive effect on the work culture, people were confident to make decisions and remedy problems without the fear of making a mistake or errors and being unsure of what to do
