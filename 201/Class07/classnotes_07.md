# HTML Tables and JS Constructor Functions

## Domain Modeling

<https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling>

**Explain why we need domain modeling.**

- its important for analsyis of features and epics
- it breaks apart problems for easier analysis

## HTML Table Basics

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics>

**Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**

- makes it hard to read the webpage
- limits flexibility (makes it harder to change things)


**List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.**

table data
```
td
```

table header
```
th
```

table row
```
tr
```

## Introducing Constructors

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors>

**What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**

**constructor:** a fucntion that allows you to create an object

- intializes the object with the default (intial) state
- it informs about dependecies 
- eaiser solutions to projects by looking at the constructor

**How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**

- object literal: its for the object being defined
- constructors: its for the object being created (it'll apply to all the classes attached to the constructor)

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

<https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype>

**Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.**

- an analogy for this would be me working as a freelance artist and i moved to learn coding. so my prototype would be the art teacher that taught me, and i inherited my art skills plus the design skills i've acquired during front-end coding 

```
**NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question**
