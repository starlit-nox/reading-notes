1. Greater Efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration

The way these can benefit me is that my partner and I would both be able to complete our projects faster and check any accuraries and issues. My strengths may be their weaknesses and their strengths may be my weaknesses, so we can effectively learn off of each other and efficieny complete work. It will also engage me in interacting with my parnter.
