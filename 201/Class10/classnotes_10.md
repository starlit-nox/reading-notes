**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

- syntax errors are when mistakes are made in the code

- logic error is  when you have the correct syntax but the portion fo the code has an error

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

- errors in lines where a semi-colon was forgotten, i looked in the console to fix it (logic error)

- errors where functions were misspelled which kept me from calling them (syntax error)

- errors where the wrong varibles were called (logic error)

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

- this topic continues to influence my long term goals because it shows that we are human and can make mistakes and just to keep going, it'll also help with figuring out how to debug and fix syntax errors

## The JavaScript Debugger
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger>

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

- each br will stop executing to let you look at the values (they work like a stop button)

- afterwards you can resume the execution of the code by hitting play

**Define what a breakpoint is.**

- they are logical points where you stop the code from executing so you can examine and debug

**What is the call stack?**

- call stack: a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in the script that calls multiple functions, and shows the errors
