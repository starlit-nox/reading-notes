# Analogy

Imagine you're playing a video game. To get better at the game, you need to practice the difficult levels, not just play the easy ones over and over again. Deliberate practice is like choosing those tough levels and repeating them until you improve. It's like leveling up your skills in the game, but in real life as a software developer.
