# Q&A

**Properties**

- What’s the difference between a static and an instance constructor?

- How does the use of a static constructor differ from setting properties/values?

**Stack and Heap**

- Knowing what you now know about the stack and the heap, how might you rethink the way you did projects in previous courses, to make more effecient use of memory?

**Garbage Collection Fundamentals**

- Compare “Garbage Collection” in C# with the lifecycle of normal household items.
