# Why Its Important:

The reason this information is important is because it could be a matter of life and death when it comes to improper codintg in the work force. When this information is used to create applications used in science, engineering, or medicial institutions, if there is a bug it could cause deadly malfunctions like what happened in the unhandled errors. To prevent these kinds of errors, we step through debuggers to find and fix the bugs and errors that could cause mishaps in advance.
