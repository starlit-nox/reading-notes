# Implementation: Stacks and Queuea

<https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html>

Stack:

- A data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) or FILO (First In, Last Out) order.
- Common operations:
  - Push: Adds a Node to the top of the stack (O(1) time complexity).
  - Pop: Removes the top Node from the stack and returns its value (O(1) time complexity).
  - Peek: Returns the value of the top Node without removing it (O(1) time complexity).
  - IsEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty, otherwise false (O(1) time complexity).

Queue:

- A data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) or LILO (Last In, Last Out) order.
- Common operations:
  - Enqueue: Adds a Node to the rear of the queue (O(1) time complexity).
  - Dequeue: Removes the front Node from the queue and returns its value (O(1) time complexity).
  - Peek: Returns the value of the front Node without removing it (O(1) time complexity).
  - IsEmpty: Returns true if the queue is empty, otherwise false (O(1) time complexity).

  ## Stacks and Queues Quiz

1. What is the main characteristic of a Stack?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A Stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) or FILO (First In, Last Out) order.
</details>

2. Which operation adds a Node to the top of a Stack?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The `Push` operation adds a Node to the top of a Stack with O(1) time complexity.
</details>

3. What does the Dequeue operation do in a Queue?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The `Dequeue` operation removes the front Node from the Queue and returns its value with O(1) time complexity.
</details>

4. What does FIFO stand for in the context of a Queue?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
FIFO stands for "First In, First Out", which means the first item added to the Queue will be the first one to be removed.
</details>

5. What is the time complexity of the Peek operation in a Queue?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The `Peek` operation in a Queue, which returns the value of the front Node without removing it, has a time complexity of O(1).
