# Operates & Loops

**Expression:** is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value

**Two types of Expressions**
1. ones with side effects
2. ones that are purely evaluate

```
Side Effect Expressions
```

Example: x = 7

The expression uses the **=** operator to assign value. 
It expresses itself to 7

```
Purely Evaluate
```

Example: 3 + 4

The expression uses **+** as the operator to added 3 and 4 together to **produce**
7.

**NOTE:** If its not used ina bigger construct (i.e variable declarations) like const z = 3 + 4 then it'll be discarded.

```
+ will add to the operation
```

```
- will remove/subtract from the operation
```

```
* will multiply
```

- Even though * and + are in different orders, both will still = 7 because * preceeds over +.

- * will always be read first


**JavaScript has both __binary__ and __unary__ operators, one special ternary operator, the conditional operator**

**Binary operator:** requires 2 operands, one BEFORE and one AFTER the operator
