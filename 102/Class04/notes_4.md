### What is a wireframe?

- a practice used by UX designers
- allows desginers to define & plan an information hiechary

Its good for getting to knw how users interact with the interface via positoning of buttons & menus on diagrams

- In short it lets you plan out the desiggn without distractions

### Wireframe Examples & Things to Consider

Some people like to draw their framewire, some applications are:

-Invision
-Balsamiq

Keep in mind when deciding your framewire:

-**Wireframes drawn with paper & pencil**, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product
-**Paper-prototypes** can test with end users at every stage of ideation & design. Changes at these stages are much easier & therefore cheaper than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
-**Switching later to software** (after intially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep tracking of more detailed decisions. 

Here are a number of ways designers structure the proces:
1. Wirerame > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
2. Sketch > Code
3. Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe >Visual > Code
4. Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

```
If the task is very narow and the visual design is either set or considered unimportant, then going from a sketch to coding/development makes sense.
