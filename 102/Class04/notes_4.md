### What is a wireframe?

- a practice used by UX designers
- allows desginers to define & plan an information hiechary

Its good for getting to knw how users interact with the interface via positoning of buttons & menus on diagrams

- In short it lets you plan out the desiggn without distractions

### Wireframe Examples & Things to Consider

Some people like to draw their framewire, some applications are:

-Invision
-Balsamiq

Keep in mind when deciding your framewire:

-**Wireframes drawn with paper & pencil**, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product
-**Paper-prototypes** can test with end users at every stage of ideation & design. Changes at these stages are much easier & therefore cheaper than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
-**Switching later to software** (after intially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep tracking of more detailed decisions. 

Here are a number of ways designers structure the proces:
1. Wirerame > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
2. Sketch > Code
3. Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe >Visual > Code
4. Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

```
If the task is very narow and the visual design is either set or considered unimportant, then going from a sketch to coding/development makes sense.

### Possible Websites to Use

- **Uxpin:** wide range of cuntionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responive, clickable prototypes directly into browser
- **InVision:** allows you to get feedback striaght from yourteam & users through clickable mock-ups of our site design. (FREE!)
- **Wireframe.cc:** provides you with the technonnlogy to create wireframes really quickly within your brower.

## When Wireframing focuses on:

- **Usability conventions:** putting the navigation at the top next to the logo, having a search box on the top, etc.
- **Simplicitity:** instructional wording for i.e calls-to-actions
- **Trust-building elemnts:** What you need to build trust in yoru customers / where would the best place to put these elments be?
- **Tooltips:** indicate any functionality that could be incldued in prototype transition


## Good Wierframe: 3 Key Principles
1. Clarity
2. Confidence
3. Simplicity is key


# HTML Basics

```
What is HTML?
Its a markup language that defines the strucutre of your content
```
## HTML Defintions

1. **Opening Tag:** consists of the name of the elemnt, wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. 
2. **Closing tag:** same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the elment name; states where the elemnt ends
3. **Content:** content of the elemnt
4. **Element:** opening tage, closing tag, and the content together comrpise the element
5. **Angle Brackets:** < >
6. **Atributes:** extra information about the ement that desn't appear in actual content
    -examples: class, editor-note
7. **Class:** atribute allows you to give the elemnt a non-unique indenfier that can be used to target it (and others with the same class value)

**Attributes that set a value always have:**
1. Space between it & the elemnt name (or previous atribute, if the elemnt already has one or more attributes)
2. Attribute name followe dby an equal sign. 
3. Atribute value wrapped by opening & closing quotation marks.



## Paragraphs

When making a paragraph use <> with the abbreviation inside of it. When closing use </>.

The abbrevation for paragraph is **p**

**FOR EXAMPLE PURPOSES, THERE ARE SPACES BETWEEN THE TAGS. DO NOT EVER ADD SPACES BETWEEN THE TAGS.**

```
My cat is very grumpy
```
```
< p > My cat is very grumpy < / p >
```
