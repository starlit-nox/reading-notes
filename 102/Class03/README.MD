## Things I want to know more about

# **Introduction to Git**

**Version Control: system that allows you to revisit various versions of files by recording changes

**Local version control:** one database on your hard drive that stores changes in files


	-short hand is VCS

**Centralized version control:** this system allowed collaboration via a single serve storing all changes & file versions so it can be accessed by multiple people

	-short hand is CVCS

**Distributed version control:** addressed major vulnerability of cvs; the server as a single point of failure. This allows clients to create mirrored repositories


	-bc DVCs allows for multiple mirrored repsorties, multiple people can work on a joint project with various workflows at the same time


	-short hand for this is DVCs

# **What is Git?**


	-its a DVC
	-it stores data in the form of snapshots

**Commit:** changing the version of your project


**Files in git can reside in three main states:**


	-committed
	-modified
	-staged

**Committed:** data is securely stored in a local database


**Modified:** file has been changed but not committed to database


**Staged:** flagged a fileâ€™s changed verison to be committed in the next snapshot
